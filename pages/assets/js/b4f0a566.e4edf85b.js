We see the missteps, and sometimes wonder about the shallow bugs that pile on. Config managers that are almost always arbitrary file upload endpoints. Glue layers that become bash command launch as a service. And most frustratingly, code generation that's excellent at pretending forward progress has been made when no meaningful change has occurred. One of the most impressive parts of agentic coding is exactly that: how convincing it is by appearance and how easily we're tricked about the depth of substance in the code gen. In some ways we extend our trust of people to the stochastic code parrots, assuming that generative coding produced the actual work a human would have probably performed."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"vibe-identity-an-obvious-flaw",children:"Vibe Identity: An Obvious Flaw"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I'm no stranger to e2e breaks, and have been following along over the past decade.

There's essentially no trust/auth built in today. So I would not really think about this as a secure messenger.

The 32-byte public key gets shuffled around with ephemeral key pairs as an opaque blob. The user verification is unfortunately disconnected from any trust and authentication.
