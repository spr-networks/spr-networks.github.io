Intro

SMBClient is macOS client code for the SMB filesystem, allowing OS X to mount remote file shares.  As of macOS Big Sur, SMB is the preferred file sharing protocol.  SMBClient is a mixture of userland and kernel code.
As a result, this represents a significant amount of attack surface.   There is, of course, the common kernel attack surface of ioctls() as well as a host of other vnode operations.  SMB network communication is generally managed within the kernel, but there are also places where this data ends up passed to userland processes.
Some of this surface is also accessible as a remote 2-click attack via the smb:// url handler.  If an attacker can coerce a user into clicking a link to a malicious server, that server is now interacting with a mix of kernel code and userland code.
It is important to note that iOS’ attack surface is different than macOS.  While there is some common code, the SMB protocol implementation doesn’t appear to run in the kernel and attacking a user would target userland, involving the Files application and SMB Frameworks.


1. Remote Kernel Heap Overflow in smb2_rq_decompress_read

At [1], compress_len is read off the wire. When using chained_compress with SMB2_COMPRESSION_LZNT1, SMB2_COMPRESSION_LZ77, SMB2_COMPRESSION_LZ77_HUFFMAN, the path at [2] is taken but compress_len is never validated for the memory copy at [3] as MB_MSYSTEM translates to a bcopy into compress_startp.  This leads to a heap memory overflow. The overflow quantity is further set by the attacker as `md_get_mem` copies on the remaining bytes in the mbuf.
The attacker also has some choice in the size of the allocated memory being corrupted as they can set the initial buffer length up to 2*kDefaultMaxIOSize (16MB) [0].
 
     buffer_len = originalCompressedSegmentSize * 2;
    SMB_MALLOC_DATA(bufferp, buffer_len, Z_WAITOK) [0];
    if (bufferp == NULL) {
        error = ENOMEM;
        goto bad;
    }
    compress_startp = bufferp;
…         if (chained_compress) {
            /* Chained compression - Get CompressedDataLength */
            error = md_get_uint32le(&compressed_mdp, &compress_len);  [1]
            if (error) {
                goto bad;
            }
            SMB_LOG_COMPRESS("compress_len: %d (0x%x) \n", compress_len, compress_len);
        }
…
                if (chained_compress) {
                    /*
                     * Handle Chained Compression
                     * Get OriginalPayloadSize
                     */
                    error = md_get_uint32le(&compressed_mdp, &original_payload_size);
                    if (error) {
                        goto bad;
                    }
                    SMB_LOG_COMPRESS("original_payload_size: %d \n", original_payload_size);
#if 0
                    /*
                     * Oddly, Windows server will send a compress length that
                     * is bigger than the decompressed length which will cause
                     * this check to fail. Why they dont just send the non
                     * compressed data?
                     *
                     * Sanity check the compress length
                     */
                    if (compress_len > (originalCompressedSegmentSize - CurrentDecompressedDataSize)) {  [2]
                        SMBERROR("Algorithm %d compress_len %d > remaining to decompress len %d? \n",
                                 algorithm, compress_len,
                                 (originalCompressedSegmentSize - CurrentDecompressedDataSize));
                        error = EINVAL;
                        goto bad;
                    }
#endif …
[3]
                /* Copy compressed data to preallocated buffer in compress_startp */
                error = md_get_mem(&compressed_mdp, (caddr_t) compress_startp, compress_len,
                                   MB_MSYSTEM);
                if (error) {
                    goto bad;
                }
The `SMB_MALLOC_DATA` macro is a wrapper for kalloc_data, so the overflow occurs on a buffer in the xnu data heap which offers some hardening by restricting the presence of pointers to overwrite.
Fix: compress_len is validated, along with several other improvements.




2. Kerberos Helper: Remote _asn1_free() on uninitialized stack variable in _KRBDecodeNegTokenInit
There is a remotely accessible free on uninitialized memory in the _KRBDecodeNegTokenInit function in Kerberos Helper, a library used during SMB session establishment.  This can be triggered by clicking on an smb:// URL or via mount_smbfs.   This can potentially result in remote code execution.
A decompilation of _KRBDecodeNegTokenInit shows:
     1 /* WARNING: Globals starting with '_' overlap smaller symbols at the same address */

     2 long _KRBDecodeNegTokenInit(undefined8 param_1,undefined8 param_2)

     3 {
...
[1] 12    union {
        NegotiationToken rfc2478;
        NegotiationTokenWin win;
    } u;
...
    19    gss_buffer_desc_struct output_buffer;
...
    25    output_buffer.length = 0;
    26    output_buffer.value = (void *)0x0;
    27    local_b0 = _CFDataGetBytePtr(param_2);
    28    local_b8 = _CFDataGetLength(param_2);
    29    local_34 = _gss_decapsulate_token(&local_b8,_DAT_7ff94001ef48,&output_buffer);
    30    if (local_34 != 0) {
[2] 31    decode_negtokenfailed:
    32      _gss_release_buffer(&local_34,&output_buffer);
    33      lVar6 = 0;
[3] 34      goto free_negtoken_3;
    35    }
...
[4] 40    u = 0;
    41    auStack_a0[0] = 0;
    42    iVar1 = _decode_NegotiationToken(output_buffer.value,output_buffer.length,&u,0);
    43    if (iVar1 == 0) {
    44      if ((int)u != 1) goto decode_negtokenfailed;
    45  LAB_7ff904084e3a:
    46      local_40 = 0;
    47    }
    48    else {
    49      auStack_a0[3] = 0;
    50      plStack_80 = (long *)0x0;
    51      auStack_a0[1] = 0;
    52      auStack_a0[2] = 0;
    53      u = 0;
    54      auStack_a0[0] = 0;
    55      iVar2 = _decode_NegotiationTokenWin(output_buffer.value,output_buffer.length,&u,0);
    56      if ((iVar2 != 0) || ((int)u != 1)) {
    57        _gss_release_buffer(&local_34,&output_buffer);
    58        lVar6 = 0;
    59        goto free_negtokenwin_2;
  ...
   120   free_gss_1:
   121     _gss_release_buffer(&local_34,&output_buffer);
   122     if (iVar1 != 0) {
   123   free_negtokenwin_2:
   124       _free_NegotiationTokenWin(&u);
   125       return lVar6;
   126     }
   127   free_negtoken_3:
[5]128    _free_NegotiationToken(&u);
   129     return lVar6;
   130   }
During authentication, NegotiationToken [1] is declared on the stack but not initialized.  If gss_decapsulate_token fails, the return value will be non-zero [2].  When gss_decapsulate_token() fails, it will goto [3] to free_negtoken_3, skipping the initialization logic for NegotiationToken [4]. At this point,  _free_NegotiationToken is called on uninitialized memory.
Skipping a few steps, _free_NegotiationToken() will ultimately call _asn1_free() (https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Heimdal/blob/dbe4ef6aab8c600de89e8f4b56d2a41c7eada4ba/lib/asn1/template.c#L868), using the token type (rfc2478 or win) as a template to parse and free the uninitialized data.  This gives multiple opportunities to manipulate memory.
Fix:
This issue was fixed by calling memset() before the NegotiationToken is used.




3. Unprivileged SIGTERM kill() via SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID
The smbfs kernel module has an ioctl called `SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID`. This ioctl is used to register the pid of the mc_notifier userland process with the kernel, as an IPC mechanism.  When an SMB mounted filesystem unmounts, the kernel will send a SIGTERM signal to the PID.
There is no check within the kernel to ensure that the userid of the process that called the ioctl can send a signal to the process belonging to the process ID submitted.
As a result, an unprivileged process can send SIGTERM to any process on the system. This will cause most processes to exit cleanly.
Since this signal is sent from the kernel, it can be used to kill launchd, immediately crashing the Mac.
This vulnerability can only be exploited if an attacker can open /dev/nsmb and can send an ioctl, so is likely not immediately exploitable from within the sandbox.
macOS’s implementation of multichannel SMB support relies on a userland process, mc_notifier.  When an SMB filesystem unmounts, the kernel will notify the mc_notifier process that the filesystem is being unmounted via the delivery of a SIGTERM signal:
        /* Signal the mc_notifier to kill itself*/
        if (mc_notifier_pid != -1) {
[1]            proc_signal(mc_notifier_pid, SIGTERM);
            mc_notifier_pid = -1;
        }
    }
Of course, the question is, how is the mc_notifier_pid set.  The answer lies in the SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID ioctl():
case SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID:
        {
            SMBDEBUG("SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID received.\n");
            lck_rw_lock_shared(&sdp->sd_rwlock);
            /* free global lock now since we now have sd_rwlock */
            lck_rw_unlock_shared(dev_rw_lck);
            lck_mtx_lock(&mc_notifier_lck);
            struct smbioc_notifier_pid* notifier_info = (struct smbioc_notifier_pid*)data;
            /*
             * Check if we already have an open notifier
             * In that case prevent from opening more then 1
             */
[1]         if (mc_notifier_pid != -1) {
                char name[1024];
                proc_name(mc_notifier_pid, (char*) &name, 1024);
                if (!strncmp((char*) &name, "mc_notifier", 11)) {
                    error = EEXIST;
                }
            } else {
 [2]            mc_notifier_pid = notifier_info->pid;
            }
…
There is a check to see if mc_notifier has been set [1] .  If it hasn’t been set, then the notifier pid will be set [2].  This ioctl can be called by any user, and amongst other things, the ioctl can be run without a filesystem being mounted, and thus prior to mc_notifier launching.  If an attacker sets this, then mounts and unmounts an SMB filesystem, they can deliver a SIGTERM directly from the kernel to any process, regardless of userid.
Most processes will exit gracefully upon receiving SIGTERM, allowing a local attacker the ability to kill any process.  This can be a denial of service, with the ability to kill most processes, including launchd (which effectively crashes the OS, requiring a reboot) and can also be used to further certain attacks.
Fix
---
This vulnerability was patched by adding an entitlement check to the SMBIOC_UPDATE_NOTIFIER_PID ioctl() call.
